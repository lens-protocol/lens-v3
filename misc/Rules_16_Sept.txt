What do we need from Rules and their Combinators?

- Customize your rule combining smaller inner rules
- You can replace a rule with another flavor, but same config and 
  If yes (at least READ):
    - You remove an inner rule, you add it back, you keep the previous config and storage state.it should work
    - Do we want to allow different rules to access the same storage? 
      - Same for the whole flavor of RuleCombinator?
  If yes (READ & WRITE):
    - One rule can change the configuration that was set by another rule (with same config option)
      





Issues we need to fix:

#1 - Nested combinators collide their storage
